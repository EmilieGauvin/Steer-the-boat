# Steer the boat!

Steer the boat to avoid the waves and try not to get water inside! 
This game was inspired by Bruno Simonâ€™s <i>Three.js journey</i> course <i>Raging sea</i> where I learned to generate a water like animation effect through shaders. From that, the trickiest part of this project was to have the boat move and rotate according to the growing movements of the sea.
Built in Three.js, React and Blender
